# FakeUser
Code for FakeUser Discord bot

The following code is used to replace every text by a user with a bot.
The warrant for this was when someone changed his username to match that of another user.
The bot was nicknamed to the user's actual name, such that when the bot replaced his texts, the texts matched his name instead of his username (i.e. the second user's name).
